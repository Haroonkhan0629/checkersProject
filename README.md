Welcome to Word Guess (A Hangman variation)

Objective: Use the letters on the chalkboard to guess what the word is. 
You will know how long the word is and as you guess letters correctly, they will pop up in the
correct place, giving you a hint as to what the word may be.

Punishment: In this virtual world, you are the emoji. The state and well-being of your 
character depends on the number of incorrect guesses you make. You will gradually become more 
and more gloomy until eventually.....
DO NOT LET IT HAPPEN
