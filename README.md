## Description
"WORD GUESS" is a variation of hangman. The user has to guess the word by filling in all of the blank spaces with the letters given. Each correct guess will show up on screen in a specific blank space giving the user a hint as to what the word may be. The user has five lives, each of which will be lost with an incorrect guess. When there is one life left, a hint will be displayed on screen for help.

## Trello Planning (MVP)
* Display blank spaces equivalent to word length
* Display a “hangman” which gets more elements added to it the more the user guesses incorrectly
* When user guess letter correctly, letter will show up in place of blank space
* When user guesses word, SUCCESS! When user keeps getting incorrect guesses, hangman will be fully added and game over
